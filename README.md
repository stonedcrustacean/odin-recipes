# odin-recipes
This project is a demonstration of the knowledge of web development acquried thus far (along with knowledge I've picked up in the past). To demonstrate the knowledge, The Odin Project is having me make a website for recipes using just HTML.

The website will consist of a main index page and will have links to a few recipes. It's going to look ugly, but it will be my baby
