        <p>
            Grilled tofu has always been a favourite of mine; a nice firm tofu subjected to the malliard effect, producing a smokey bite full of protein; paired with the savoury acidity of tomatos, this sandwich may quickly become your favourite too! If tofu isn't your thing, I suggest substituting it with halloumi cheese which gives the sandwich a firmer bite while still retaining that rich <em>umami</em> flavour we all know and love.

            Ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>2 pita bread</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons tahini</li>
                <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
                <li>4 slices of firm tofu</li>
                <li>1 dash of soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            Steps
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your grill to medium</li>
                <li>Split the pita breads in half so that you have 4 round pieces. Spread mayonnaise on one half of each one, and tahini on the other half. Place tomato slices onto the mayonniase halves, and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Place 2 slices of tofu onto the tahini halves, and dash them with a bit of soy sauce (less is more). Place ensemble onto a large baking sheet</li>
                <li>Grill until hot and the bread is lightly toasted; this should take about 4 minutes. Close the halves of each sandwich together and cut into wedges to serve.</li>
            </ol>
